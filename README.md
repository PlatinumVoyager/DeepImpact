DeepImpact is a suite of Network discovery tools utilized to acquire/obtain information on remote hosts/systems which can be further de-constructed to gain an understanding of LOCAL or REMOTE targets across ALL domains. Information returned will be propagated through a relational database to match and compare information that was collected via differential time stamps.

*NOTE: This project is still in early development. Current Python3 source code has been supplemented to demonstrate the networking features/functions that will be available as it's complete. Stand by.*

**UPDATE: DeepImpact will be imported as a module to NEToolset Framework at a later date. Stand by.**
